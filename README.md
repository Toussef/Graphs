DFS:

DFS is an algorithm for graph traversal. It functions by traversing from the initial vertex upto the last vertex that is reachable by the current branch. When it does reach the last branch, it backtracks recursively to search for alternate paths following the branch to see what verticies can be visisted.

This code was written by me to demonstrate my knowledge regarding C and its syntax!
